# Project Landing-Page (Owlsite)

# Project Description
Making a website from scratch using all the skills given from 
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project </a> (TOP) using a provided design.
I followed the guidelines, but added my own design and ideas.
I have made a small website about owls, because I think they are 
very beautiful mystical animals.
